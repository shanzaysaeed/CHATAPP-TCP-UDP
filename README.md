-Created a custom, dependable transport protocol in Python featuring the ReliableMessageSender class to transmit messages reliably in segmented chunks.

-Implemented a sliding window mechanism to optimize packet transmission efficiency and ensure secure, ordered delivery over unreliable networks.

-Incorporated checksums for packet integrity and devised timeout handling mechanisms for effective retransmissions.

-Executed the Link-State routing algorithm implementation within a network simulator, managing independent routers and events such as packet handling and link alterations.

-Employed sequence numbers to differentiate between old and new updates, integrating Dijkstra's algorithm for computing shortest paths.

-Implemented periodic routing packets to ensure continuous network updates and stability.
